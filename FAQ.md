### Can I add Rabbasca to an existing save?
Yes, this mod does not alter any vanilla content.

### Can I start a new playthrough here?
Yes, this mod is fully compatible with the Any Planet Start mod. 
Note however, that since Rocket silos are unavailable on Rabbasca until the late game, your second planet will be Gleba.
Prepare accordingly.

### I can't place any power generators on Rabbasca?
Correct. There is some power available to get a decent base going. For bigger factories, use the technologies this moon provides.
