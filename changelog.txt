    - This update adds challenging content to the late game and reorganizes some rabbascan technologies
    - Purified Harene is now the powerful but hard to create resource it was meant to be
    - Haronite plate and purified harene recipes changed, making them much harder to acquire
    - Haronite plate is now also placeable on space platforms, providing energy to E.A.R.S. cores
    - Added upgrades to Protein shake, Turbofuel and Beta carotene made from purified harene, requiring promethium science to unlock
    - Added new late-game technology to extract warp pylons from vaults
    - Total available power on Rabbasca can now be changed via setting
    - Vault protection pylons will now create alerts when spawned
    - Deprecated Railway expansion technology and changed the default for its setting. Other mods solve vehicle grids much better. It will be removed in a future update.

  Balancing:
    - Reduced default total available power on Rabbasca to 30MW
    - E.A.R.S. core technology 1 cost increased to 500. to compensate, Assembling machine 1 and 2 with E.A.R.S. are available earlier

    - Increased vault access console resistances
    - Increased protection pylon max health. It will now stay around a bit longer
    - Warp pylon construction range now scales with quality (range indicator does not adjust though). Base range slightly reduced to 20
    - Rocket part from Turbofuel now requires a new item instead of haronite plate to keep the costs reasonable
