rabbasca-cap-bunnyhop-research=Remove Bunnyhop infinity research, limiting jumps to moons and close planets only.
rabbasca-bunnyhop-force-naked=Makes it impossible to carry items during bunnyhops, reducing it to a quicker alternative to using the rocket silo.\nWith this enabled, exporting items from Rabbasca will be impossible until the late game. Only use this option if you plan to move your science setup to Rabbasca, or don't need any Rabbascan tech.
rabbasca-bunnyhop-rabbasca-only=Makes the [item=bunnyhop-engine] unusable on any planet other than Rabbasca.
rabbasca-evolution-per-vault=Rabbasca's evolution alternative is calculated by multiplying this value in percent by the number of currently hacked vaults.\nA value of 2.5 means that every time exactly 10 vaults are hacked, evolution on Rabbasca will be 25%.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-briefing=The surface of [planet=rabbasca] is a vast desert with occasional fertile areas, where [entity=carotenoid-ore] can be found. Ponds of [fluid=energetic-residue] house large [entity=rabbasca-turbofish] populations, which can be eaten to help with quick terrain traversal.\nThe moon's [entity=rabbasca-energy-source] provides some electricity, but it also renders all your electricity generators, [item=solar-panel] and [item=accumulator] useless. You will need to find other ways to satisfy the power demand of your machines to expand your factory here. Maybe the [entity=rabbasca-vault-crafter]s located here provide a way of making this possible.\nLike space platforms, the electric grid here is globally available. [item=medium-electric-pole] are not required for power, but can still be used to check the current energy situation. 
rabbasca-vaults=[entity=rabbasca-vault-crafter] are defended structures found on [planet=rabbasca] contain an endless supply goods stored by their long-gone creators. Hacking them with [item=vault-access-key] grants temporary access and disables its defenses.\nHacked vaults can be instructed to eject stored content in exchange for [item=carotenoid-ore] or [fluid=beta-carotene]. This gives access to raw resources like [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], [item=calcite], [item=sulfur] and is the only way to obtain [item=haronite] and [item=harene-ears-core].\nThe bot defenses only react to nearby military threats. They will never attack your factory, not even drills mining the close-by [entity=rabbascan-scrap].\nEach [entity=rabbasca-vault-console] raises global alertness, boosting defenses and making it harder to secure further vaults.
rabbasca-bunnyhop=[item=bunnyhop-engine] allows [entity=character] to directly jump between planets without the need for [entity=rocket-silo]. Items can be carried along, but maximum weight and jump distance are limited initally and require further research.\nUse [shortcut=activate-bunnyhop-engine] to start the launch sequence, then run around to charge the engine. The engine will not charge if carrying too much weight.\nOnly space locations with a direct connection can be jumped to, i.e. on [planet=rabbasca], you can jump only jump to [planet=gleba].\nJumping long distances like from [planet=fulgora] to [planet=aquilo] is possible, but requires lots of research in [technology=bunnyhop-engine-4].
