[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-briefing=The surface of [planet=rabbasca] is a vast desert with occasional fertile areas, where [entity=carotenoid-ore] can be found. Ponds of [fluid=energetic-residue] house large [entity=rabbasca-turbofish] populations, which can be eaten to help with quick terrain traversal.\nThe moon's [entity=rabbasca-energy-source] provides some electricity, but it also renders all your electricity generators, [item=solar-panel] and [item=accumulator] useless. You will need to find other ways to satisfy the power demand of your machines to expand your factory here.\nMaybe the [entity=rabbasca-vault]s located here provide a way of making this possible.
rabbasca-vaults=[entity=rabbasca-vault] are defended structures found on [planet=rabbasca] contain an endless supply goods stored by their long-gone creators. Hacking them with [item=vault-access-key] grants temporary access and disables its defenses.\nHacked vaults can be instructed to eject stored content in exchange for [item=carotenoid-ore] or [fluid=beta-carotene]. This gives access to raw resources like [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], [item=calcite], [item=sulfur] and is the only way to obtain [item=haronite] and [item=harene-ears-core].\nThe bot defenses only react to nearby military threats. They will never attack your factory, not even drills mining the close-by [entity=rabbascan-scrap].\nEach [entity=rabbasca-vault-console] raises global alertness, boosting defenses and making it harder to secure further vaults.
rabbasca-bunnyhop=[item=bunnyhop-engine] allows [entity=character] to directly jump between planets without the need for [entity=rocket-silo]. Items can be carried along, but maximum weight and jump distance are limited initally and require further research.\nUse [shortcut=activate-bunnyhop-engine] to start the launch sequence, then run around to charge the engine. The engine will not charge if carrying too much weight.\nOnly space locations with a direct connection can be jumped to, i.e. on [planet=rabbasca], you can jump only jump to [planet=gleba] through [space-connection=gleba-rabbasca].\nJumping long distances like [space-connecton=fulgora-aquilo] is possible, but requires lots of research in [technology=bunnyhop-engine-4].
