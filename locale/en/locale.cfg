[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
rabbasca-briefing=The surface of [planet=rabbasca] is mostly a barren desert where [item=calcite] and [item=carbon] are plenty and some [item=ice] can be found. Occasional ponds of [fluid=energetic-residue] have surfaced with cracks of [entity=harene-vent] and a [entity=rabbasca-turbofish] population.\nThe moon's [entity=rabbasca-energy-source] provides some electricity, but it also renders generators, solar panels, etc. useless. You will need to find other ways to satisfy the power demand of your machines to expand your factory here.\nMaybe the [entity=rabbasca-vault]s located here provide a way of making this possible. However, accessing them might trigger defensive responses...
